Incorporate jQuery Plugins & jQuery UI into the Vecta Corp Web Site

In this assignment you’ll practice working with jQuery and jQuery UI. Specifically, you will add several jQuery UI components to the Vecta Corp. web site to make it more usable and interactive.

General 

•	Use the jQuery UI Tooltip widget and add more descriptive text to each navigation menu item. For instance, when the user rolls over Solutions it may read “Vecta Corp. offers 3 solutions for prospecting, converting, and retaining customers.” Each of the 5 should be unique. Make sure to add this feature to all 5 pages of the Vecta Corp. site.

Home Page

•	Add the jQuery UI Tabs widget to the home page to divide up the 3 Vecta Corp solutions into an easy to navigate horizontal tabbed menu. There will be 3 tabs, 1 for each Vecta Corp. solution. When the user clicks a tab, the information (along with the product image) should appear. Add this widget to the area directly underneath the heading: Our Solutions.
•	Add the jQuery UI Accordion widget to the home page to divide up the 2 client testimonials. Add this widget to the area directly underneath the heading: Client Testimonials.

About Us

•	Add the jQuery UI Tabs widget to the Management Team section within this page to divide up the 5 Vecta Corp managers into an easy to navigate vertical tabbed menu. There will be 5 tabs, 1 for each Vecta Corp. manager. When the user clicks a tab, the bio for each manager should appear. Add this widget to the area directly underneath the heading: Management Team.
•	Use the jQuery Cycle2 plugin to create an auto-rotating slideshow for the new Vecta Corp headquarters. Be sure to add some kind of clickable navigation so that the user can cycle between different images. The images to use for this plugin are located in the images folder.

Solutions

•	Add and format the Solutions content within the Our Solutions heading. Add a quick nav that links the user down to the particular section within the page. Use Google to find a StikkyNav plugin so that when the user clicks a solution on the Quick Nav, the Quick Nav stays in plays and doesn’t move. Also, use Google to find a jQuery Back to Top plugin that you can add to this page that allows the user to easily and smoothly navigate back up to the top of the page.

Contact US

•	Convert the radio buttons into jQuery UI radio buttons.
•	Convert the checkboxes into jQuery UI checkboxes.
•	Convert the drop down menu into a jQuery UI selectmenu. 
•	Convert the submit button into a jQuery UI button. When the user clicks submit, display a jQuery UI dialog box that thanks the user for their inquiry…then process the submission.
